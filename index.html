          <p class="text-muted"> This school church is an important pillar for the school. This school church helped our
            students get closer to god and will for years to come. Many people ignore their religion and one of the
            reasons are studies. But not here. We believe our religion comes first. So, If a prayer is due we will
            ensure we pray no matter what. And this church is proof of that. </p>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> The food options and responsibilities to
          consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus
          with photographs of the dish prepared, and detailed descriptions of the ingredients help both students and
          parents make the right nutritional choices according to their food preferences. Each studen or staff member
          who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps
          track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a
          box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less
          complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key. </p>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> This informs parents about their
          child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents
          will be informed about the status via text messages. This help schools keep a record of the students'
          absenteeism. students can mark the attendence by logging in, and this is stored in database, which can
          later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are
          irregular to classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their
          curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's Enrollment Number or Name, details like
          availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since
          the trackeris supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be robust and powerful that
          those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span - just after the admin enteres
          login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and tansparency in any of the educational
          institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests
          and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs. </p>
